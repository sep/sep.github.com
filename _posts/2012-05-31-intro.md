The intent of this blog is to be a place to share short practical snippets of things you do every day that you'd like to share with other folks.

I'm envisioning things like shell/command prompt tricks, or a cool C# snippet.

If you have something that you'd like to share or contribute, [mailto:fullerjc+bitsandbytes@gmail.com](shoot me an email), stop by my desk, tweet at me [http://twitter.com/jonfuller](@jon_fuller), send me a [http://github.com/sep/sep.github.com](pull request), or anything else you can think of.

Here's an example of what a typical post will look like:

---

<Category> - <Platform>

Short description maybe including some `code` or a `snippet`.

    usage of the actual command

Some additional context on usage and how or why you use it every day.  This could be a one sentence testimonial, or a paragraph if it takes some explaining as to what's going on.  Anyways, please contribute!
