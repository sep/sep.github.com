Shell (~bash) - Windows/OS X

Even though I love my shell, sometimes I want the gui.  Quickly open up a Windows Explorer or Finder window pointed to your current working directory with the `explorer` or `open` command (respectively).

Windows

    explorer .

OS X

    open .

Of course, you can do many more things with both the `open` and `explorer` commands, but I use this one constantly.
