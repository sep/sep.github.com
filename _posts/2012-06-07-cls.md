Shell (~bash) - OS X, Windows, Linux

I live in the shell as much as possible.  Sometimes it's hard to see what's going on because there is so much junk in my scrollback (btw, you ought to up your scrollback to as large as possible, you never know when you need to scroll up through a week's worth of work to see something you did last Monday).

Anyways, sometimes I just want to clear the screen.  Wouldn't you know it...

    clear

That's for bash-ish shells.  If you're in Windows, it's:

    cls

(It stands for clear screen)
