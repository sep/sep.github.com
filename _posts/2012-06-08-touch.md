Shell (~bash) - Windows/OS X/Linux

Occasionally (okay, at least once a day) I find myself needing to create an empty file.  Sometimes it's to make sure I have write permissions in a particular directory, other times I want to create the file and then edit it in `vim`.

It's easy enough to right click in the folder and click `create new file`, but if you're already in the shell (and why aren't you?), just try this command.

    touch path/to/the/file/you/want/to/create

The `touch` command creates an empty file.  If the file already exists, it update the modified timestamp in the filesystem for that file.
