cmd.exe - Windows

Did you know you can use the up/down arrows in `cmd` (or a `Visual Studio Command Prompt` to scroll back through your history of commands?  Of course you knew that... nothing new there.

Did you know you could press `F7` and see a visual version of your history?

If you're in Windows, and use cmd.exe, this looks really helpful.
