Shell (~bash) - OS X, Windows, Linux

Change to your previous directory using the special directory marker `-`.

    > pwd
    >> /Users/jcfuller/Downloads
    > cd /Users/jcfuller/dev/github
    > pwd
    >> /Users/jcfuller/dev/github
    > cd -
    > pwd
    >> /Users/jcfuller/Downloads

I use this quite a bit when I need to run a command from a specific directory, but then want to get right back to where I was.
