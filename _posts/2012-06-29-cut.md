Shell (~bash)

Recently, when proofreading my `xargs` post, a coworker asked "Cut? What does that do?" So, back into the trenches to investigate one of the super-cool, fundamental building blocks of really great command line concoctions.

    % echo "1,red,grumpy\n2,orange,sleepy\n3,yellow,doc"
    1,red,grumpy
    2,orange,sleepy
    3,yellow,doc
    
    % echo "1,red,grumpy\n2,orange,sleepy\n3,yellow,doc" | cut -d, -f2
    red
    orange
    yellow

According to the man page, `cut` "cuts out selected portions of each line of a file". As usual, instead of an input file, we can use the output of some other command piped in through stdin. the `-d,` option above tells `cut` that the lines to be processed are comma-delimited. The `-f2` specifies that we want the second "field" in each line returned.

To conserve some typing, let's set up a file to experiment on:

    % echo "1,red,grumpy,monday\n2,orange,sleepy,tuesday\n3,yellow,doc,wednesday" \
    >> test.txt


Now, we can use `cut` on the file rather than stdin:

    % cut -d, -f2 test.txt
    red
    orange
    yellow

We can also do multiple fields in several ways:

    % cut -d, -f2,4 test.txt
    red,monday
    orange,tuesday
    yellow,wednesday

    % cut -d, -f2-4 test.txt
    red,grumpy,monday
    orange,sleepy,tuesday
    yellow,doc,wednesday

    % cut -d, -f2- test.txt
    red,grumpy,monday
    orange,sleepy,tuesday
    yellow,doc,wednesday

    % cut -d, -f-3 test.txt
    1,red,grumpy
    2,orange,sleepy
    3,yellow,doc

One important caveat...`cut` won't reorder fields:

    % cut -d, -f2,4 test.txt
    red,monday
    orange,tuesday
    yellow,wednesday
    
    % cut -d, -f4,2 test.txt
    red,monday
    orange,tuesday
    yellow,wednesday

Reordering fields takes something a little more sophisticated; like `awk` or a `while` loop. (More on `awk` and `while` later.)

`cut` will, however, happily work on bytes or characters rather than delimited fields if you have data that's already columnar. Look at the output of `ps`, for example:

    % ps x
    PID   TT  STAT      TIME COMMAND
    251   ??  Ss     0:00.95 /sbin/launchd
    254   ??  S      0:01.30 /usr/libexec/UserEventAgent -l Aqua
    256   ??  S      0:06.10 /usr/sbin/distnoted agent
    259   ??  S      0:02.46 /System/Library/Frameworks/ApplicationServices.frame
    261   ??  S      0:00.01 /usr/sbin/pboard

`cut` can condense and pick out just the pieces you want to see:

    % ps x | cut -c-6,18-40 
    PID      TIME COMMAND
    251   0:00.97 /sbin/launchd
    254   0:01.30 /usr/libexec/
    256   0:06.13 /usr/sbin/dis
    259   0:02.47 /System/Libra
    261   0:00.01 /usr/sbin/pbo

So, go experiment with `cut`. It does one pretty straightfoward thing...and it does it really well.
