Shell (~bash)

Recently, when proofreading my `xargs` post, a coworker asked "Cut? What does that do?" So, back into the trenches to investigate one of the super-cool, fundamental building blocks of really great command line...um...commands.

    % echo "1,red,grumpy\n2,orange,sleepy\n3,yellow,doc"
    1,red,grumpy
    2,orange,sleepy
    3,yellow,doc
    
    % echo "1,red,grumpy\n2,orange,sleepy\n3,yellow,doc" | cut -d, -f 2
    red
    orange
    yellow

According to the man page, `cut` "cuts out selected portions of each line of a file". As usual, instead of an input file, we can use the output of some other command piped in through stdin. the `-d,` option above tells `cut` that the lines to be processed are comma-delimited. The `-f 2` specifies tat we want the second "field" in each line returned.

To conserve some typing, let's set up a file to experiment on:

    % echo "1,red,grumpy,monday\n2,orange,sleepy,tuesday\n3,yellow,doc,wednesday" \
    >> test.txt


Now, we can use `cut` on the file rather than stdin:

    % cut -d, -f2 test.txt
    red
    orange
    yellow

We can also do multiple fields in several ways:

    % cut -d, -f2,4 test.txt
    red,monday
    orange,tuesday
    yellow,wednesday

    % cut -d, -f2-4 test.txt
    red,grumpy,monday
    orange,sleepy,tuesday
    yellow,doc,wednesday

    % cut -d, -f2- test.txt
    red,grumpy,monday
    orange,sleepy,tuesday
    yellow,doc,wednesday

    % cut -d, -f-3 test.txt
    1,red,grumpy
    2,orange,sleepy
    3,yellow,doc
